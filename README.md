# Food Prime
Food Prime is a mobile application built with Flutter that allows users to browse available fruits, add them to a cart, and place orders. The app supports full CRUD operations for managing fruits and orders, uses Supabase for backend services (authentication and database), implements BLoC for scalable state management, and uses Dependency Injection to decouple components for better maintainability
